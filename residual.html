       <p>Mainly serve as defense line along the perimeter of premise essential when it comes to controlling a wide area or heavy infestation.The basic idea behind residual sprays is to apply an insecticide to surfaces, which creates a barrier that insects will come into contact with and die from. Residual sprays typically contain a synthetic pyrethroid or organophosphate insecticide, which is a chemical compound that disrupts the nervous system of insects, leading to paralysis and eventual death. Residual sprays are usually applied to areas where insects are likely to come into contact with, such as walls, floors, furniture, and other surfaces. The insecticide will remain active on these surfaces for a period of time, typically several weeks, providing continuous protection against insect infestations.</p>
